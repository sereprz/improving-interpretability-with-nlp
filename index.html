# Framework

* Methodology
  
  * Pre-trained NLP models
  
  * Unsupervised ML

* Extract information:
  
  * Rules
  
  * What entities are responsible for compliance
  
  * Difference between public and private responsibilities
  
  * Organize rules into homogeneous groups based on the entity responsible

---

class: top

## A little grammar

### Subject:

* The word or phrase that indicates “who” or “what” performs the action of the verb

* Entities that are responsible for complying with rules

.remark-code[
<b style="color: blue">Every employer</b> shall provide individualized workplace emergency response information to employees who have a disability
]

---

class: top

## A little grammar

### Object:

* The entity that is acted upon by the subject

* The rule specification

.remark-code[
Every employer shall provide <b style="color: blue">workplace emergency response information</b> to employees who have a disability

# Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act  (AODA)

* Statute and regulation passed in 2015

* Defines rules and requirements for accessibility

* Sets out processes for eliminating barriers

* **Burden**: a requirement or obligation that organizations have to comply with
  
  * Physical and architectural barriers
  
  * Documentation
  
  * Training

# 3 steps

![](img/framework-of-analisys.png)

---

class: top

# Step 1. Burdens extraction

  * Limited vocabulary: {shall, must, oblige, require} + synonyms
  
  * For each sentence:
    
    1. Extract all words
    
    2. If any of words is included in the set, label it as burden
  
  * 0.89 Accuracy (proportion of sentences correctly classified)
  
  * 0.97 recall (proportion of burdens classified labeled as burdens)

---

class: top

# Step 2. Subject Identification

**Problem**: Long and complicated sentences where the subject may be a sentence on its own

1. Use a Dependency Parser to represent the syntactic relationships between words as a tree structure

2. Navigate the sub-tree of the subject to identify all the words that define it

---
.remark-code[
<b style="color: blue">Obligated organizations that are school boards or educational or training institutions</b> shall keep record of the training provided
]

# Step 3. Subjects clustering

## Objective:

Organize burdens into homogeneous groups based on the entities that they affect
    
  * Any kind of pattern or regularity?
  
  * Difference between public VS private responsibilities?
  
  * Similarities across industries?

---

class: top
  
# Step 3. Subjects clustering

## Solution:

1. Represent the subjects of the burdens in a vector space

  i. Sentence normalization (e.g. delete stopwords)

# Step 3. Subjects clustering

## Solution:

1. Represent the subjects of the burdens in a vector space
  
  i. Sentence normalization (e.g. delete stopwords)

  ii. Vector representation

    * Project each word into a semantic space<br>
      `king - men + woman = queen`!

## KMeans Clustering

* Partition n data points in k clusters

* Each data points is assigned to the cluster with the nearest mean

* The average/centroids of the clusters serve as prototypes for the groups
